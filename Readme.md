# Leuchtturmparser 🕯
This Go project aims to extract menu information from the Leuchtturm's website using OCR. I am using this app from my phone as shortcut via ssh in order to get the current menue suggestion. Kind of hacky: the website has cloudflare protection making requests from my vps. That's why i provided a `-hashtml` option to provide the static website content locally. Using the option a `content.html` has to be provided.
